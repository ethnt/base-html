# base-html

This is a basic boilerplate for any HTML-based application.

## Usage

To take advantage of Compass and CoffeeScript, you'll need Ruby and Bundler installed. Then, run:

```
$ bundle install
```

Then start up Guard to watch the `css/src` and `jsc/src` directories:

```
$ bundle exec guard
```
